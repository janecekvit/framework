TODO:
- Check concurrent and atomic_concurrent
- Finish extensions.h cleanup
- use this c++23 in all files
- Rewrite asserts that use good style (expected value, actual value)
- Better formatting
- Create readme.md
- Minimum supported version c++17 -> test it
- Use wait_for_multiple_signals in _sync_thread
- Implement notify all in signal condition variable and add testing for it


EXTRA:
Create c++ compile time DI
